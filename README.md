# A* Pathfinding Visualization
<img src="Example_maze.png" alt="Example" width="400"/>


## Description

This A* Pathfinding Visualization tool is designed to illustrate the workings of the A* algorithm—a highly efficient and widely used pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It visually simulates the process of finding the shortest path between two points.

## Features

- Visual representation of the A* algorithm in real-time.
- Customizable grid size and obstacle placement for diverse pathfinding scenarios.
- Dynamic start and end point selections.
- Maze generation for testing the algorithm against complex paths.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BohdanBabii/A_star_pathfinding_visualization.git
cd A_star_pathfinding_visualization
```
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Visualization

To start the visualization, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

- Left-click to place or remove obstacles.
- Right-click to select and move the start (orange) and end (blue) points.
- Press 'Space' to begin the pathfinding.
- Press 'c' to clear the grid and start over.
- Press 'm' to generate a random maze.
